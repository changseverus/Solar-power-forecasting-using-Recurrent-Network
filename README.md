# Solar-power-forecasting-using-Recurrent-Network

Built a LSTM model to predict the daily output of solar panels.

Solar power forecasting is a challenging and important problem. The solar energy generation forecasting problem is closely linked to the problem of weather variables forecasting. This problem is usually split into two parts, on one hand focusing on the forecasting of solar PV (solar panel system) or any other meteorological variable and on the other hand estimating the amount of energy that a concrete power plant will produce with the estimated meteorological resource. In general, the way to deal with this difficult problem is usually related to the spatial and temporal scales we are interested in. This project focusses on a simplified forecasting model using previously generated data from solar panel to predict the future.

### Goal

Using historic daily production of a solar panel, we want to predict the total power production of the solar panel array for a future day. We will be using an LSTM based time series prediction model to predict the daily output of a solar panel based on the initial readings of a the day.
